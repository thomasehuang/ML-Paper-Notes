Inspired by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes), I've decided to start keeping track of papers I'm reading for documentation purposes and as a way to force myself to read more.

06-2018:
- [SeqGAN: Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient](SequenceGeneration/SeqGAN.md) \[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05473)\]
